# Reverse Madlibs #

"That litho spurred changeability can bestow timeously like a comeuppance!"

__Features of Reverse Madlibs Command Line Game__
  1. Prompts user for a sentence with `NOUN`s, `VERB`s, `ADJECTIVE`s and/or `ADVERB`s
  2. Always adds new sentences to the end of a sentence list during a user prompt
  3. Randomly selects a sentence from the sentence list to use as a help eaxample during the prompt
  4. Alliteration mode ensures that all madlib words begin with the same letter
  5. Changes the article "a" to "an" before nouns that start with vowels
  
__Downfalls__
  1. Attempts to simply congugate by adding "-ing" or "-s" often result in incorrect spellings 
  2. Nouns currently can only be pluralized by adding an "-s". There's no way to differentiate when to use "-es" and when to use "-s".
  3. Alliteration mode makes the program run waaaaaaaaaay slower.
