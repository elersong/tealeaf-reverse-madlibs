# Reverse Madlibs #

"That litho spurred changeability can bestow timeously like a comeuppance!"

__Features of Reverse Madlibs Command Line Game__
  1. Prompts user for a sentence with `NOUN`s, `VERB`s, `ADJECTIVE`s and/or `ADVERB`s
  2. Always adds new sentences to the end of a sentence list during a user prompt
  3. Randomly selects a sentence from the sentence list to use as a help eaxample during the prompt
  4. Alliteration mode ensures that all madlib words begin with the same letter
  
__Downfalls__
  1. There's no way to conjugate verbs from their infinitive version
  2. Attempts to simply congugate by adding "-ing" or "-s" often result in incorrect spellings 
  3. Nouns currently can only be pluralized by adding an "-s". There's no way to differentiate when to use "-es" and when to use "-s".
  4. The article "a" doesn't change to "an" before a noun that starts with a vowel.
  5. Alliteration mode makes the program run waaaaaaaaaay slower.
