# Pseudocode Algorithm
# ====================
# 1. Explain to user how a "reverse madlib" works
# 2. Prompt user for a sentence with some words left out
# 3. Save that sentence to the "catalog" list of sentences (if it's not already on the list)
# 4. Process the sentence and replace any instance of NOUN with a random word from the nouns.txt file
# 5. Print that sentence to the console
# 6. Ask the user if he wants to reload the same sentence again, choose from the catalog, add a new one or exit
